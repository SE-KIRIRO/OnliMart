# Introduction

I have set about to build a functional e-commerce platform. the shop is called OnliMart and look dont bash me on the naming i'm not a creative person. the shop will enable clients to browse products, add then to the cart, apply discount codes, go through the checkout process, pay with credit cart and obtain an invoice. I will also implement a recommendation engine to recommend products to my customers, and finally I will use internatiolization to offer my site in multiple languages.
